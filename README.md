# Hello, I am Max Boulat

## About me

I am a software engineer with a knack for developing and shipping end-to-end solutions from scratch. I am currently puruing a MS in Applied Artificial Intelligence at USD. 

## Research

- 🧑‍💻 Predicting credit default risk with financial & demographic factors
  - **Goal**: Analyze the effects of various factors on credit default risks using Naive Baye's and Logistic Regression
  - **Tech stack**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
  - **Results:** Both models performed similarly, class imbalance caused poor recall for credit defaulters.

  - [Paper](https://github.com/MaximeBoulat/AAI500-TeamProject/blob/main/Final-Project-Report-Team-1.pdf)

- 🧑‍💻 Imitation learning for 2D maze navigation with A* as the expert
  - **Goal**: To generate synthetic data by making A* solve randomly generated mazes and train an assortment of models to learn A* obstacle avoidance and goal seeking behavior.
  - **Tech stack**: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pygame
  - **Results**: Models trained on the synthetic data were able to navigate new randomly generated mazes without mistakes as long as the path to the goal did not involve too many complications.

  - [Paper](https://github.com/MaximeBoulat/AAI501-TeamProject/blob/main/FinalProject/Submission/FinalTeamProjectGroup4.pdf)
 
- 🧑‍💻 Multi-Agent financial analysis system
  - **Goal**: To build a Agentic AI application using LangGraph that incorporates key patterns such as planning, routing, prompt chaining, tool use and state persistence
  - **Tech stack:** LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI API, PyTorch, FinBERT
  - **Result:** Functioning Intelligent Investment Advisor that peforms multi-stage analysis for any stock symbol.

- 🧑‍💻 Object detection for self-driving using 2D representations of LiDAR data
  - **Goal:** To specialize a YOLO model to recognize vehicles and pedestrians in a 2D raster representation of raw LiDAR data, repurposing RGB channels to height. intensity and density.
  - **Tech stack:**  Ultralytics YOLOv12, nuScenes SDK, PyTorch
  - **Results:** Good performance on objects with large LiDAR footprints like cars and trucks, more difficulty with smaller objects such as cyclists and pedestrians. Real-time visualization of model predictions on reconstructed 3D scenes.
